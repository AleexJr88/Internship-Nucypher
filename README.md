# Nucypher-TFG
Hi I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ and I'm finishing my computer engineering degree at the University of Malaga.

The Nucypher-TFG repository will focus on my project of the University Extension Course in Blockchain Technologies organized by the University of Malaga.

The Objectives of the work plan are those that appear in the pdf with the same name. 

For phase 1, I have used the matic js github repository to be able to perform the necessary functions (burn and exit)

The commands required for this phase were:

1. npm run build
2. node examples/POS-client/Ether/function.js

Being function burn or exit. When executing node examples/POS-client/Ether/burn.js it printed the hash of the transaction on the console and thus know if everything was going well
